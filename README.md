# Practice 2 - AngularJS - Web Programming

This project aims to implement the logic of package delivery applications, allowing you to log and track package shipments through this page.

## Installing AngularJS
To create a project in AngularJS format, run the command:
```bash
ng new project_name
```
This will create the project in which the various codes found in the repository will be implemented.

## Downloading the Project
The project must be downloaded from Github, and the files must be added to the src folder.

Angular includes several scaffolding tools that automate the basic structure of a project by creating folders, code, and other components. To create a component, run the following:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```
This gives you access to a complete list of available schemas. To learn about the different components that Angular has, run the following command:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Starting the Project
To start the project, run the command:
```bash
ng serve
```
Once the project is started, open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload based on changes made to the project files. Once these two actions are completed, you can navigate through the project.

## Use

The project contains different pages that you can navigate and interact with.
- Order Log: allows you to create new orders.
- Order Update: updates the status of an order and saves its information.
- Package Tracking: allows you to view the history of a package's status.
